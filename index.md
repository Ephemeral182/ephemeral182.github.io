My name is **Sixiang Chen (陈思翔)**. I received my bachelor degree in Communication Engineering from the School of Ocean Information Engineering at Jimei University, where I was extremely fortunate to be supervised by ***[Dr. Erkang Chen](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=hWo1RTsAAAAJ)*** and ***[Dr. Yun Liu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=9fjHp-EAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)*** (Southwest University). My research interests lie in the AIGC and low-level vision. I am currently a first-year PhD student at HKUST@[ROAS](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/systems-hub/robotics-and-autonomous-systems/), supervised by ***[Prof. Lei Zhu](https://sites.google.com/site/indexlzhu/home?authuser=0)*** and ***[Prof. Fugee Tsung](https://www.ieda.ust.hk/dfaculty/tsung/)***.
